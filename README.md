# Blue 
- Ah, like every day I see,
Another day repeats, I'm yawning all the time.
After all the cheers, the night, it fades out and
Shibuya receives a pour of the morning light.
And somehow, an emptiness surrounds.
That's what I always feel something is not enough.
That's how it's gonna be, it's all a part of life, I'll let this be.

See what, see what, covered deep inside
Let us hear the voice in you, and resonate in you, hold on
Pretending won't bring it out of sight
It is always waiting there for you
